    <p> Jay Chou, the song of Qilixiang, quoted the poem Qilixiang written by Xi Murong as the name. 
      The album's main song Qilixiang also found Fang Wenshan to fill in the words in the way of 
      writing poems. Fang Wenshan got inspiration from Xi Murong, saying that he was not writing 
      lyrics, but writing poems. Jay Chou said that composing music with poetry is a challenge, 
      but it is poetic and emotional.</p>
